      "detailed_answer": "**Common Causes of Revenue Decline:**\n\n**1. Fan Churn (Most Common):**\n- Check Dashboard → Fans → Churn Rate\n- If >10% monthly = problem\n- Action: Re-engagement campaign, message at-risk fans\n\n**2. Reduced Posting:**\n- Compare posts this period vs. last period\n- Consistency matters more than volume\n- Action: Return to regular posting schedule\n\n**3. Content Quality/Fit:**\n- Check recent content engagement rates\n- Lower engagement = lower revenue\n- Action: Analyze top performers, create similar content\n\n**4. Pricing Issues:**\n- Too much free content?\n- PPV prices too high?\n- Action: Review pricing strategy\n\n**5. External Factors:**\n- Seasonal trends (holidays, summer)\n- Economy/fan spending power\n- Platform algorithm changes\n- Action: Diversify revenue sources\n\n**Diagnostic Checklist:**\n1. ✅ Check fan count (losing subscribers?)\n2. ✅ Review posting frequency (posting less?)\n3. ✅ Check content engagement (quality decline?)\n4. ✅ Review moderation queue (rejections?)\n5. ✅ Compare to previous successful period\n\n**Recovery Plan:**\n- Post high-value PPV content\n- Run limited-time promotion\n- Message VIP fans personally\n- Create exclusive content\n- Increase posting to 5x/week\n- Re-engage inactive fans\n\nIf decline continues >2 weeks, submit support ticket for account review.",

      "detailed_answer": "**Churn Rate Explained:**\n\nChurn Rate = (Canceled Fans ÷ Total Fans at Start) × 100\n\nExample: 100 fans at month start, 8 cancel = 8% churn\n\n**Benchmarks:**\n- **Excellent:** <5% monthly\n- **Good:** 5-10% monthly\n- **Average:** 10-15% monthly\n- **Problem:** >15% monthly\n\n**Why Fans Cancel:**\n1. Lack of new content (40%)\n2. Price vs. value mismatch (25%)\n3. Personal financial reasons (20%)\n4. Found other creators (10%)\n5. Technical issues (5%)\n\n**How to Reduce Churn:**\n\n**Prevention (Best Strategy):**\n- Post consistently (3-5x weekly)\n- Engage with fans regularly\n- Deliver value matching price\n- Mix free and paid content\n- Respond to messages\n- Run fan appreciation events\n\n**Retention Tactics:**\n- Welcome message for new subscribers\n- Exclusive content for long-term fans\n- Loyalty rewards/discounts\n- Monthly Q&As or polls\n- Birthday/anniversary messages\n\n**Win-Back Campaigns:**\n- Email to recently canceled fans\n- Offer 30% off to return\n- \"We miss you\" personalized message\n- New content announcement\n\n**Acceptable Churn:**\nSome churn is normal and healthy. People's interests change, budgets shift. Focus on:\n- Net growth (new fans > churned fans)\n- Lifetime value (how much fans spend before leaving)\n- Keeping VIP fans happy (top 20% = 80% revenue)\n\nA 7% churn rate with 15% new fan acquisition = 8% net growth (good!)",
