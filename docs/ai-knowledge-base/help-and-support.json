Your ticket will be reviewed by:\n   - Senior support agent\n   - Team lead\n   - Specialist (for technical issues)\n\n3. Response time: 24-48 hours\n\n**Example Escalation Request:**\n```\nI appreciate the response, but I don't believe this solution\naddresses my issue. Specifically:\n\n1. [Explain what wasn't addressed]\n2. [What you need instead]\n3. [Why the proposed solution won't work]\n\nCould a senior agent or specialist review this case?\nThank you.\n```\n\n**Step 2: Executive Review (If Still Unsatisfied)**\n\nFor serious unresolved issues:\n1. Request \"Executive Review\" in your ticket\n2. Summarize the full situation\n3. Explain previous responses and why inadequate\n4. State your desired resolution\n\n**When Available:**\n- After escalation didn't resolve issue\n- For policy disputes\n- For significant account problems\n\n**Response:** 3-5 business days (final decision)\n\n**Step 3: Provide Feedback**\n\nAfter ticket closes:\n- Complete satisfaction survey\n- Rate support experience (1-5 stars)\n- Explain what could be improved\n\n**Your feedback helps us:**\n- Improve agent training\n- Identify process gaps\n- Enhance support quality\n\n**What NOT to Do:**\n\n❌ **Don't spam multiple tickets** - Slows everyone down\n❌ **Don't be rude to agents** - They want to help\n❌ **Don't threaten** - Doesn't improve outcomes\n❌ **Don't bypass support** - Go through proper channels\n\n**Alternative Options:**\n\n- **Community Forums:** Ask other users' opinions\n- **Help Center:** Research alternative solutions\n- **Live Chat:** Get second opinion from different agent\n\n**Remember:** Support agents genuinely want to help.
