Automated AI Scanning (Instant)**\n- Every upload is scanned automatically\n- Detects prohibited content, age verification, malware\n- 95% of content is auto-approved within seconds\n\n**2. Human Review (1-24 hours)**\n- Handles flagged content and user reports\n- Reviews edge cases and appeals\n- Makes final decisions on policy violations\n\n**What happens to your content:**\n1. Upload → AI scans (10-60 seconds)\n2. If approved → Goes live immediately\n3. If flagged → Human review (1-24 hours)\n4. If reported → Priority human review\n\n**Check your status:** Dashboard → Content Health\n\nMost creators see 95%+ auto-approval rates. Content that follows guidelines rarely needs human review.",
