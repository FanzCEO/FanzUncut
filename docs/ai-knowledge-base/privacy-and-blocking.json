      "answer": "**How to Block a User:**\n\nBlocking completely prevents someone from interacting with you or seeing your content.\n\n**Method 1: From Their Profile**\n\n1. Go to the user's profile\n2. Click the menu icon (⋮ or •••)\n3. Select **Block User**\n4. Confirm by clicking **Block**\n\n**Method 2: From a Message**\n\n1. Open the message thread\n2. Click the user's name or settings icon\n3. Select **Block User**\n4. Confirm\n\n**Method 3: From a Comment**\n\n1. Find their comment on your post\n2. Click the menu icon on the comment (⋮)\n3. Select **Block User**\n4. Confirm\n\n**Method 4: From Settings**\n\n1. Settings → Privacy & Safety → Blocked Users\n2. Click **Add User to Block List**\n3. Enter their username\n4. Click **Block**\n\n---\n\n**What Blocking Does:**\n\n**They CANNOT:**\n- ❌ View your profile\n- ❌ See any of your posts or stories\n- ❌ Send you messages\n- ❌ Comment on your content\n- ❌ Subscribe to you (or renew if subscribed)\n- ❌ Tip you\n- ❌ Purchase your content\n- ❌ See you in search results\n- ❌ Tag or mention you\n\n**Important:**\n- They are NOT notified they're blocked\n- Your profile appears as if you deleted your account\n- All past interactions are hidden from both sides\n- Their subscription (if active) is canceled\n- No refund issued (they used the service up to block point)\n\n---\n\n**Unblocking:**\n\n1. Settings → Privacy & Safety → Blocked Users\n2. Find the user in your blocked list\n3. Click **Unblock**\n4. Confirm\n\n**Note:** Unblocking immediately restores their full access.\n\n---\n\n**When to Block:**\n\n✅ **Block Immediately If:**\n- Harassment or abusive messages\n- Requests for personal information\n- Threatens you\n- Makes you uncomfortable\n- Violates your boundaries\n- Tries to move conversation off-platform\n- Stalking behavior\n- Attempts to doxx you\n\n**You Never Need a Reason:**\n- Block anyone, anytime, for any reason\n- Your comfort and safety come first\n- No explanation required\n- Platform supports your decision\n\n---\n\n**Alternative: Restrict Instead of Block**\n\nIf you want softer approach:\n- **Restrict** limits their interactions without fully blocking\n- They can still subscribe (if you want the revenue)\n- But their messages go to requests, comments need approval\n- They don't know they're restricted\n\nTo Restrict: Same process as blocking, choose **Restrict** instead.\n\n**Remember: Your safety matters more than anyone's feelings. Block freely!** 🔒",

Settings → Privacy → Automatic Protections\n2. Enable these:\n\n```\n☑ Strip EXIF data from photos\n   (Removes GPS coordinates)\n\n☑ Remove GPS location from uploads\n   (Prevents location tracking)\n\n☑ Remove metadata from videos\n   (Strips recording location)\n\n☑ Warn me if potential identifying info detected\n   (Smart detection of backgrounds, signs, etc.)\n```\n\n**Manual Check Before Posting:**\n- No street signs visible\n- No business names showing\n- No unique landmarks\n- No reflections showing windows with street views\n- No mail/packages with addresses\n- No car license plates\n- Generic backgrounds\n\n---\n\n**Method 3: Don't Share Location Clues**\n\n**Never Post:**\n- ❌ \"At [Restaurant Name]\"\n- ❌ \"Beautiful day in [City]!\"\n- ❌ \"Check out my neighborhood\"\n- ❌ Real-time locations (\"Live from...\")\n- ❌ Photos of your house exterior\n- ❌ Local landmarks\n- ❌ Work/school locations\n\n**Smart Posting:**\n- ✅ Post vacation photos AFTER you return\n- ✅ Use generic descriptions (\"At the beach\" not \"Malibu Beach\")\n- ✅ Remove geotagging from all photos\n- ✅ Generic backgrounds\n- ✅ No time-specific content (\"sunrise\" reveals timezone)\n\n---\n\n**Method 4: Hide Profile from Local Searches**\n\n1.

Keep their $25/month subscription but don't get constant notifications.\n\n---\n\n**Situation 3: Ex or Acquaintance**\n> Someone you know IRL subscribed, it's awkward\n\n**Action:** RESTRICT or BLOCK (your choice)\n**Reason:** \n- RESTRICT if you want to keep them as subscriber (they can see content)\n- BLOCK if you don't want them seeing anything at all\n\n---\n\n**Situation 4: Boundary Pusher**\n> \"Can we meet up?\" \"What's your real name?\" \"Add me on Instagram\"\n\n**Action:** BLOCK\n**Reason:** Violating clear boundaries, will likely escalate\n\n---\n\n**Situation 5: Clingy but Harmless**\n> Comments on every post, messages frequently, tips occasionally, no threats\n\n**Action:** RESTRICT\n**Reason:** Keep revenue, reduce overwhelm, harmless fan\n\n---\n\n**HOW TO RESTRICT:**\n\n**Same Process as Blocking:**\n\n1.

Generic Bio (No Personal Info)**\n```\nBad: \"25 year old from Miami, FL. Marketing grad from UM.\"\nGood: \"Creative content creator.
