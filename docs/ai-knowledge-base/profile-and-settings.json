      "answer": "**Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n\n**Why Enable 2FA:**\n- ✅ Prevents unauthorized account access\n- ✅ Protects your earnings and content\n- ✅ Required for accounts earning $1000+/month\n- ✅ Adds extra security layer beyond password\n\n**How to Enable 2FA:**\n\n**Step 1: Go to Security Settings**\n1. Settings → **Security**\n2. Click **Two-Factor Authentication**\n\n**Step 2: Choose Method**\n\n**Option A: Authenticator App** (Recommended)\n- Most secure method\n- Works offline\n- Faster than SMS\n\n**Setup:**\n1. Download authenticator app:\n   - Google Authenticator (iOS/Android)\n   - Authy (iOS/Android/Desktop)\n   - Microsoft Authenticator\n\n2. In platform settings, click **Setup Authenticator**\n3. Scan QR code with authenticator app\n4. Enter 6-digit code from app\n5. Save backup codes (IMPORTANT!)\n6. Confirm setup\n\n**Option B: SMS Text Message**\n1. Click **Setup SMS Authentication**\n2. Enter phone number\n3. Verify phone with code sent via text\n4. Save backup codes\n5. Confirm setup\n\n**Option C: Email**\n1. Click **Setup Email Authentication**\n2. Codes sent to your verified email\n3. Less secure but works if no phone access\n\n**Step 3: Save Backup Codes**\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Write down and securely store backup codes!\n\n- Used if you lose phone/app access\n- Each code works once\n- Store in password manager or safe place\n\n**Login with 2FA Enabled:**\n\n1. Enter username and password\n2. Open authenticator app\n3. Enter current 6-digit code\n4. Access granted\n\n**Lost Access to 2FA?**\n\n**If you have backup codes:**\n1. Use backup code to login\n2. Disable and re-setup 2FA\n\n**If you lost backup codes:**\n1. Click \"Lost access to 2FA?\"\n2. Verify identity (may take 24-48 hours)\n3. Support will reset 2FA\n\n**Manage 2FA:**\n\nSettings → Security → **Two-Factor Authentication**\n\n- View authentication method\n- Regenerate backup codes\n- Switch methods (SMS to app)\n- Disable 2FA (requires password)\n\n**Pro Tip:** Use an authenticator app instead of SMS for better security. SMS can be intercepted, but app-based codes cannot. Also works when traveling internationally!",
