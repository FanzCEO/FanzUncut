      "answer": "**Increase Comments on Your Posts:**\n\n**1. Ask Questions (Most Important!)**\n\nEvery post should end with a question:\n- ❓ \"What do you think?\"\n- ❓ \"Should I do more of this?\"\n- ❓ \"A or B?\"\n- ❓ \"What's your favorite...?\"\n- ❓ \"Which outfit for tomorrow?\"\n\n**2. Create Polls**\n- Use built-in poll feature\n- 2-4 options\n- Easy for fans to participate\n- Low barrier to engagement\n\n**3. Run Contests**\n- \"Best comment wins free PPV content!\"\n- \"Random commenter gets a prize\"\n- Creates incentive to comment\n\n**4. Respond to Every Comment**\n- When you respond, it encourages more comments\n- Aim for 80%+ response rate\n- Respond within 24 hours\n- Even simple replies (\"Thanks!\" \"❤️\") matter\n\n**5. Post at Right Times**\n\nGo to **Dashboard** → **Analytics** → **Best Times to Post**\n\n- See when your fans are most active\n- Post during peak hours\n- Higher visibility = more engagement\n\n**6. Engage First**\n- When you post, stay online for 30 minutes\n- Respond to first comments immediately\n- Creates momentum\n- Other fans see activity and join in\n\n**7. Make It Easy**\n- Don't ask complex questions\n- Use emojis: \"Drop a ❤️ if you agree!\"\n- Single-word answers OK\n- Lower the participation barrier\n\n**8. Call Out Engagement**\n- \"Love reading your comments!\"\n- \"You guys always make me smile with your responses\"\n- \"Best comment section on FanzUncut!\"\n\n**What NOT to Do:**\n\n❌ Generic captions (\"Hey\" \"New post\")\n❌ No questions or engagement prompts\n❌ Ignoring existing comments\n❌ Posting and disappearing\n❌ Making fans feel unappreciated\n\n**Pro Tip:** Posts with questions get 3-5x more comments than posts without. The single biggest change you can make is ending every post with a question!",

      "answer": "**Best Practices for Responding to Comments:**\n\n**1. Response Rate Target**\n- Aim for **80%+ response rate**\n- Respond within **24 hours**\n- Consistency matters more than speed\n\n**2. Personalization**\n\n**Good:**\n\"Thanks @username! That's a great suggestion 💕\"\n\n**Bad:**\n\"Thanks\" (copy-pasted to everyone)\n\n**Use Fan's Name:**\n- Shows you see them as individual\n- Creates personal connection\n- Makes them feel valued\n\n**3. Create Conversation**\n\n**Instead of:** \"Thanks!\"\n**Try:** \"Thanks! What would you like to see next?\"\n\n**Instead of:** \"Appreciate it!\"\n**Try:** \"So glad you enjoyed! Which was your favorite part?\"\n\n**Ask follow-up questions to keep conversation going**\n\n**4. Response Templates (Customize Before Sending)**\n\n**For Compliments:**\n\"Thank you so much [name]! Comments like yours make my day 💕 What type of content do you enjoy most?\"\n\n**For Questions:**\n\"Great question [name]! [Answer their question] Have you tried [related topic]?\"\n\n**For Suggestions:**\n\"Love this idea [name]! I'm adding it to my content calendar. What else would you like to see?\"\n\n**For First-Time Commenters:**\n\"Thanks for your first comment [name]! So happy to see you engaging 🎉 What made you subscribe?\"\n\n**5. Timing Strategy**\n\n**Immediate (0-2 hours):**\n- First 3-5 comments\n- Creates momentum\n- Other fans see activity\n\n**Throughout Day (2-24 hours):**\n- Batch responses in 3 sessions\n- Morning, afternoon, evening\n- 20-30 minutes each\n\n**6. Emojis & Tone**\n\n✅ Use emojis (but don't overdo it)\n✅ Keep tone positive and friendly\n✅ Match your brand personality\n✅ Show enthusiasm\n\n**7. Handle Difficult Comments**\n\n**Rude Comment:**\n**Option 1:** Ignore (don't feed negativity)\n**Option 2:** \"I appreciate your feedback, but let's keep it positive!\"\n**Option 3:** Delete or restrict user\n\n**Demanding Comment:**\n\"I love your enthusiasm! I create content I'm inspired by, but I always appreciate suggestions 💕\"\n\n**8. Recognition & Rewards**\n\n**For Super Fans:**\n\"You're always so supportive [name]! Check your DMs for a surprise 💕\"\n\nSend them free PPV or special content\n\n**9. What to Avoid**\n\n❌ Ignoring comments\n❌ Copy-paste same response to everyone\n❌ Arguing with fans\n❌ Being defensive\n❌ Taking days to respond\n❌ Generic \"Thanks\" to everyone\n\n**10. Track Your Performance**\n\nGo to **Dashboard** → **Engagement** → **Comment Response Rate**\n\n- See your response rate\n- Average response time\n- Identify gaps\n\n**Pro Tip:** Set aside 3 dedicated times per day for comment responses. This creates routine and ensures you never fall behind. Fans notice and appreciate when you consistently engage!",
