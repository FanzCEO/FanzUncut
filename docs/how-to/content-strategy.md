## Content Batching & Workflows

Work smarter, not harder.

- 1 planning session = Month's calendar

### Benefits of Batching

**Time Efficiency:**
- ✅ Setup once, shoot multiple
- ✅ Reduce setup/breakdown time
- ✅ Stay in creative flow
- ✅ 3-4 hours = 2 weeks of content

**Quality:**

- 20-30 photos total
- 10-15 posts from one shoot

**Multiple Locations, One Look:**
- Same outfit
- 3-5 different spots
- Variety in backgrounds
- Different vibes/aesthetics

**Outfit Change Speedrun:**
- Set up camera/lighting
- Quick outfit changes
- 10 outfits in 2 hours
- 50+ photos

**Video Batching:**

**Single Session, Multiple Topics:**
- Record 5-10 short clips
- Different topics/angles
- Edit into separate posts
- 1 hour = 10 videos

**Talking Head Batch:**
- Set up good lighting

### Batching Best Practices

**1. Prepare Everything in Advance**

Before shooting:

- Save B-roll for later

**4. Create Content Buffer**

**Always Stay 1-2 Weeks Ahead:**
- 14 posts scheduled
- Safety net for emergencies
- No scrambling
- Consistent posting even when sick/busy

**5. Batch Similar Tasks**

**Group by task type:**
- All photography one day
- All editing next day
- All caption writing same session
- All scheduling at once

**Efficiency through focus.**

## Quality vs. Quantity

Find the right balance for sustainable success.

### The Quality-Quantity Matrix

**High Quality + Low Quantity:**
- ⚠️ Risk: Inconsistency
- Amazing content, but infrequent
- Fans may lose interest

**Low Quality + High Quantity:**
- ⚠️ Risk: Poor value perception
- Lots of mediocre content
- Fans feel underwhelmed
- Higher churn rate

**Low Quality + Low Quantity:**
- ❌ Avoid

- Rapid decline

### Finding Your Balance

**For New Creators:**

**Month 1-3:**
- **Priority: Quantity**
- Focus on consistency
- Post daily (even if simple)
- Build momentum
- Improve quality over time

**Month 4-6:**
- **Balance Quality & Quantity**
- 60% good quality
- 40% can be casual
- Establish standards

**Month 7+:**
- **Increase Quality**
- More professional content
- Maintain quantity
- Sustainable high standards

### Quality Standards

**Good Enough is Good Enough:**

Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress.

**Minimum Quality Standards:**
- ✅ In focus
- ✅ Good lighting
- ✅ Proper framing
- ✅ No glaring errors
- ✅ Appropriate for audience

**Not required:**
- ❌ Professional camera (phone OK!)
- ❌ Studio lighting (natural light works)
- ❌ Perfect editing (basic is fine)
- ❌ Professional model (be yourself!)

**The 80/20 Rule:**
- 80% of results from 20% of effort
- Don't spend hours on diminishing returns
- Good > Perfect
- Done > Perfect
