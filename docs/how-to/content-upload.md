## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How long does moderation take?
**A:** Typically 2-4 hours. During peak times (evenings, weekends), it may take up to 24 hours. Content flagged for manual review can take up to 48 hours. You'll receive a notification when your content is approved or if it needs changes.

### Q: Can I edit content after publishing?
**A:** Yes! Go to your Media Library, find the content, and click "Edit". You can change title, description, tags, and pricing. Visual content (the photo/video itself) cannot be changed - you'll need to delete and re-upload.

### Q: What's the best content to charge for (PPV)?
**A:** Reserve PPV for your most exclusive, high-value content: professional photoshoots, long-form videos (10+ minutes), collaborations, or custom requests. Keep 70% of content for subscribers to maintain value of subscription. PPV content typically earns 2-3x more than subscriber-only content.

### Q: How many times per week should I post?
**A:** Aim for 3-5 posts per week minimum. Top earners post 5-7 times weekly. Consistency matters more than volume - posting 3x/week regularly is better than 7x one week and 0x the next. Use stories daily to maintain presence between posts.

### Q: Why was my content rejected?
**A:** Common reasons: policy violations, unclear age verification, missing co-star verification, prohibited content, copyright infringement, or quality issues. Check your rejection notice for specific reason and guidance. Contact support if unclear.

### Q: Can I schedule posts in advance?
**A:** Yes! After filling out all details, click "Schedule" instead of "Publish". Choose date and time (up to 30 days in advance). Scheduled content posts automatically and goes through moderation at scheduled time, not when scheduled.

### Q: What happens to earnings from deleted content?
**A:** You keep all earnings generated before deletion. Any active PPV access or subscriptions remain valid until expiration. Deleted content is removed from your profile immediately but fans who already purchased PPV can access it for 30 days.

### Q: Should I watermark my content?
**A:** Highly recommended! Watermarks deter theft and help identify your content if reposted elsewhere. Use semi-transparent watermarks in multiple locations. Enable auto-watermarking in Settings > Content Protection.

### Q: How do I know what content performs best?
**A:** Check Analytics in your dashboard. Look for:
- Views and engagement rate
- Subscriber conversion rate
- Revenue per post
- Peak viewing times
- Top-performing tags and categories

### Q: Can fans download my content?
**A:** No, platform prevents downloads by default. Content protection includes:
- Download prevention
- Screenshot detection (watermark added)
- Right-click disabling
- Encrypted streaming for videos
