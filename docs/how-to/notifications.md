   - Check email quota not full

5. **Push Notification Issues**
   - App up to date?

   - Re-install app if needed

### Receiving Too Many Notifications

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Enable Quiet Hours**
   - Settings → Notifications → Quiet Hours
   - Set your sleep schedule
   - Set work hours if needed

   - Engagement: Summary instead of individual

4. **Disable Low-Value**
   - Individual likes → Daily summary

   - Marketing emails → Unsubscribe

### Wrong Notification Sound

4. **Clear Cache**
   - Settings → Storage → Clear Cache

   - May need to allowlist domain

3. **Verify Email Address**
   - Make sure it's correct
   - Try different email provider
