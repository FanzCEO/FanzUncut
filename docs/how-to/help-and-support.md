Agent Sarah: Hi! How can I help you today?

You: I'm trying to upload a video but it keeps failing at 50%

Agent Sarah: I can help troubleshoot that. What file format is
your video?

You: MP4

Agent Sarah: And how large is the file?

You: About 800MB

Agent Sarah: Got it. Let's try a few things:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try uploading from a different browser
3. If possible, compress the video to under 500MB

Can you try option 1 first and let me know if it works?

You: OK, clearing cache now...

You: It worked! Upload is progressing past 50% now. Thanks!

Agent Sarah: Excellent! Glad that solved it. Large files can
sometimes cause issues if browser cache is full. For future
reference, we recommend compressing videos over 500MB for
best results. Is there anything else I can help with?

You: No, that's all. Thank you!

Agent Sarah: You're welcome! I'm emailing you a transcript of
this chat. Have a great day!
