### Q: Can I export my analytics data?
**A:** Yes! Click "Export Data" in the top right of any analytics view. Choose format (CSV, Excel, PDF) and date range. Great for tax purposes, personal tracking, or deeper analysis in spreadsheet tools.

### Q: What's a "good" engagement rate?
**A:** 8-15% is good, >15% is excellent. Engagement rate = (Likes + Comments + Tips) ÷ Views. Higher engagement means your content resonates with your audience. Focus on engagement over raw views.

### Q: Why did my revenue spike/drop suddenly?
**A:** **Spikes:** Viral content, successful promotion, featured on platform, special event, or seasonal trend. **Drops:** Mass cancellations, reduced posting, content policy violation, increased competition, or seasonal downturn. Check Recent Activity for clues.

### Q: How do I compare my performance to other creators?
**A:** Platform provides anonymized benchmarks (see "Industry Average" on some metrics). Focus on YOUR growth over time rather than others. Every niche, audience, and creator is different. Consistent personal improvement > comparison.

### Q: Can I see which fans view my content most?
**A:** Yes! Go to Fans → View Details → Sort by "Most Active". You'll see fans ranked by views, engagement, and time spent on your profile. Great for identifying VIPs to give extra attention.

### Q: What's the difference between "views" and "unique viewers"?
**A:** **Views:** Total number of times content was viewed (one fan can view multiple times). **Unique Viewers:** Number of different fans who viewed. Example: If 10 fans each view your video 3 times = 30 views, 10 unique viewers.

### Q: How can I see which content generates the most revenue?
**A:** Dashboard → Content Performance → Sort by "Revenue". You'll see your highest-earning content. Analyze what these posts have in common (length, topic, price, timing) and create more similar content.

### Q: Why don't my dashboard numbers match my payout amount?
**A:** Dashboard shows gross revenue (before platform fee). Payouts show net amount (after platform fee and processing fees). Also, pending revenue isn't included in available payout balance until cleared (2-7 days).

### Q: Can I set custom analytics alerts?
**A:** Yes! Settings → Notifications → Analytics Alerts. Set thresholds for revenue goals, engagement drops, fan churn, content performance, and more. Get notified via email, push notification, or in-app alert.
