## <a name="appeals"></a>⚖️ Appeal Process

### When to Appeal

Appeal a moderation decision if:
- You believe the decision was incorrect
- You can provide additional context or evidence
- The content complies with guidelines but was misunderstood
- Technical error occurred in automated scanning

**Don't appeal if:**
- Content clearly violates policies (wastes time, may hurt standing)
- You want to argue about the rules themselves
- Appeal is just emotional venting

### How to File an Appeal

**Step 1: Gather Evidence**
- Screenshots of content
- Consent forms or model releases
- ID verification documents
- Timestamps or metadata
- Previous approvals of similar content

**Step 2: Submit Appeal**

1. Go to **Support** → **Appeals**
2. Click **"File New Appeal"**
3. Fill out appeal form:
   - **Content ID:** (found in original moderation notice)
   - **Original Decision:** (e.g., "Content Removed - Policy Violation")
   - **Reason for Appeal:** (select from dropdown)
   - **Your Explanation:** (detailed, factual explanation)
   - **Supporting Evidence:** (upload documents/screenshots)
4. Submit

**Step 3: Wait for Review**
- Appeals reviewed within 3-5 business days
- You'll receive email notification of decision
- Decision is **final** (no secondary appeals)

### Appeal Outcomes

| Outcome | What It Means | Next Steps |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Appeal Granted** | Original decision overturned | Content restored, strike removed |
| **Appeal Partially Granted** | Content approved with changes | Edit content per guidance, resubmit |
| **Appeal Denied** | Original decision upheld | Content remains removed, strike stands |

### Writing a Strong Appeal

**Bad Appeal Example:**
```
This is BS! My content didn't violate anything. You guys always
target creators like me. I want my content restored NOW or I'm
leaving this platform!
```
❌ Emotional, no evidence, threatening

**Good Appeal Example:**
```
Appeal for Content ID: #abc123

I'm appealing the removal of my video titled "[Video Name]" which
was flagged for "Non-consensual content."

Evidence of Compliance:
1. All 3 participants are verified 18+ (IDs on file)
2. Signed consent forms attached (dated same day as shoot)
3. Content was reviewed and approved by me and participants before posting
4. Similar content previously approved (Content IDs: #xyz789, #def456)

Context:
The "struggle" theme in the video is fantasy roleplay, clearly
indicated in the title and description. All participants are
professional performers with experience in this genre. Safe words
were established before filming.

This content complies with Section 4.3 of Content Guidelines
regarding consensual adult roleplay.

I believe this was incorrectly flagged by automated scanning and
respectfully request human review.

Thank you for your time.

## <a name="best-practices"></a>💡 Best Practices

### For Creators: Avoid Moderation Issues

**1. Verify Everyone's Age**
```
✓ Keep copies of all model IDs (government-issued)
✓ Verify age BEFORE filming, not after
✓ Use platform's built-in ID verification system
✓ For content with other creators, check their platform verification
```

**2. Get Explicit Consent**
```
✓ Written consent forms for all participants
✓ Verbal confirmation on camera at start of recording
✓ Keep consent documents for 7 years minimum
✓ Allow participants to withdraw consent (remove content if requested)
```

**3. Self-Review Before Posting**
```
✓ Watch entire video before uploading
✓ Check for anything that could be misinterpreted
✓ Ensure all participants appear clearly 18+
✓ Add content warnings if borderline
✓ Use pre-upload checker for risky content
```

**4. Tag Accurately**
```
✓ Use all applicable content warnings
✓ Be honest about content themes
✓ Over-tag rather than under-tag
✓ Update tags if you receive feedback
```

**5. Watermark Everything**
```
✓ Add your username watermark to all content
✓ Makes content harder to steal and repost
✓ Helps prove ownership in copyright disputes
✓ Place watermark where it can't be easily cropped
```

**6. Respond to Reports Professionally**
```
✓ Stay calm and factual in appeal responses
✓ Provide evidence, not emotion
✓ Accept mistakes if you made an error
✓ Learn from feedback to improve future content
```

### For Fans: Responsible Reporting

**When to Report:**
- You genuinely believe content violates policies
- You see prohibited content (illegal, non-consensual, minors)

- Content was stolen from another creator

**When NOT to Report:**
- You simply don't like the content (just unsubscribe)
- You have a personal grudge against the creator
- Content is adult but not illegal
- You're trying to silence someone you disagree with

**How to Report Responsibly:**
1. Be specific about the violation
2. Provide context if needed
3. One report per issue (don't spam multiple reports)
4. Accept the moderation decision even if you disagree

**False Reports:**
- Repeated false reports may result in YOUR account being suspended
- Our system tracks report accuracy
- Malicious reporting is against our policies

## <a name="faq"></a>❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does automated scanning take?**
A: Usually 10-60 seconds depending on file size. Videos take longer than photos.

**Q: Can I see what the AI scanner detects?**
A: Yes, click on any uploaded content → "View Moderation Report" to see detailed scan results.

**Q: What happens if I get 3 strikes?**
A: 3 strikes = permanent account termination. Strikes expire after 90 days of good standing.

**Q: Can I remove a strike by deleting the content?**
A: No. Once a strike is issued, deleting the content doesn't remove it. You can appeal, or wait 90 days for it to expire.

**Q: Is there a way to "pre-verify" risky content?**
A: Yes! Use the Pre-Upload Checker (Settings → Content Tools) to scan content before uploading.

**Q: What if a fan reports my content out of spite?**
A: All reports are reviewed by humans. False reports won't result in penalties. Repeated false reporting by the fan will get THEM suspended.

**Q: Can I appeal a permanent ban?**
A: Permanent bans cannot be appealed in most cases. Only if you can prove account compromise (hacking) or severe technical error.

**Q: Are my private messages moderated?**
A: Private DMs are only reviewed if reported or if automated scanning detects illegal content (CSAM, trafficking, etc.).

**Q: What if I accidentally uploaded prohibited content?**
A: Delete it immediately and contact support to explain. Honest mistakes are treated differently than intentional violations.

**Q: How do I prove consent for roleplay content?**
A: Keep signed consent forms, email/text confirmations from participants, and ideally record a brief "consent check-in" at the start of filming.

**Q: Can I disagree with a specific policy?**
A: You can provide feedback via Support → "Policy Feedback", but you must comply with current policies while using the platform.

**Q: What's the difference between a "warning" and a "strike"?**
A: **Warning** = Verbal caution, no penalty, good for first-time minor issues. **Strike** = Formal violation on your record, counts toward suspension/ban.

**Q: How do I check my account standing?**
A: Dashboard → Content Health → See your standing badge (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, or Black).

**Q: Can I delete my moderation history?**
A: No. All moderation actions are permanent records. However, strikes expire after 90 days.

**Q: What if someone is stealing and reposting my content?**
A: File a DMCA takedown report (Support → Copyright → File DMCA). Provide proof of ownership. We typically respond within 48 hours.
