### Mass Message Best Practices

**Frequency:**
- Maximum 1-2 per week
- Too many = fans disable notifications
- Quality over quantity

**Timing:**
- Send when fans are most active
- Evenings (7-10 PM) perform best
- Avoid early mornings (before 9 AM)
- Platform shows "Best Time to Send" suggestion

**Content:**
- Make it valuable (not just "check my new post")
- Create FOMO (fear of missing out)
- Exclusive content works best
- Tease without revealing everything

**Subject/Preview:**
- First line is the preview
- Make it intriguing
- Use emojis for attention
- Keep under 50 characters

**Good Examples:**
- "🔥 Just filmed something WILD you need to see..."
- "💕 I made this just for you... unlock to see 😘"
- "🎁 Special surprise inside! (Limited time only)"

**Bad Examples:**
- "New post" (too generic)
- "Check out my latest upload" (boring)
- "Hi" (no value proposition)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I message fans who aren't subscribed?
**A:** By default, only subscribers can message you and vice versa. You can enable "Allow messages from non-subscribers" in Settings → Privacy, but they'll need to send a paid message unlock to initiate (you set the price).

### Q: How much should I charge for paid messages?
**A:** $5-15 is the sweet spot. Photos: $3-10, Short videos: $5-15, Long videos: $15-30. Test different prices and track unlock rates. Higher prices work for truly exclusive content to engaged fans.

### Q: Should I respond to every message?
**A:** Ideally yes, but it depends on volume. Prioritize: 1) VIP fans, 2) Paid unlocks, 3) Questions, 4) Compliments. For high volume (>100 messages/day), use templates and prioritize quality over quantity. At least acknowledge everyone within 24 hours.

### Q: Can fans screenshot my messages?
**A:** Yes, fans can screenshot any message on their device. Watermark sensitive content and avoid sharing anything you wouldn't want public. The platform shows you if someone takes a screenshot (notification).

### Q: How do I handle inappropriate messages?
**A:** Block and report immediately. Right-click conversation → Block & Report → Select violation reason. You don't owe anyone your time or attention. Platform reviews reports and takes action against violators.

### Q: Can I see if someone read my message?
**A:** Yes! Blue checkmarks indicate: ✓ = Sent, ✓✓ = Delivered, 🔵✓✓ = Read. "Typing..." indicator shows when they're composing a reply.

### Q: What's the best time to send mass messages?
**A:** Evenings 7-10 PM EST perform best (40% higher open rates). The platform analyzes your fans' activity and shows "Optimal Send Time" suggestion when you compose mass messages. Avoid early mornings and lunch hours.

### Q: Can I unsend a message?
**A:** Yes, within 5 minutes of sending. Hover over message → Click "..." → Delete for Everyone. After 5 minutes, you can only delete for yourself (fan still sees it).

### Q: How do I know if a fan is VIP?
**A:** VIP badge (👑) appears next to their name. VIPs are your top 20% spenders or most engaged fans. The platform automatically calculates this based on spending and engagement.

### Q: Can I schedule messages?
**A:** Yes! For mass messages, click "Schedule" when composing. For DMs, use third-party tools or browser extensions. Native DM scheduling coming soon.
