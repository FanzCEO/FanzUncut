            (instant)            (80% to you)    (twice monthly)   (3-5 days)
```

**Revenue Split:**
- **You earn:** 80% of all revenue
- **Platform takes:** 20% (covers processing, hosting, support, features)

**Example:**

- Payment processor fee: ~$0.30 (deducted from platform's 20%)

### Types of Earnings

## <a name="subscriptions"></a>🔄 Subscription Revenue

### How Subscription Revenue Works

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):**

Fan subscribes → Charged monthly → You earn 80% each month

**Example:**
- You set subscription price: $9.99/month
- Fan subscribes November 15
- They're charged $9.99 on the 15th of every month
- You earn $7.99 (80%) each month they stay subscribed

### Subscription Pricing

**Recommended Price Ranges:**

| Creator Level | Suggested Price | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| **New Creator** | $4.99 - $7.99 | Low barrier to entry, build base |
| **Established** | $9.99 - $14.99 | Sweet spot for most creators |
| **Premium/Niche** | $19.99 - $29.99 | Exclusive content, loyal fanbase |
| **Elite/Celebrity** | $39.99 - $49.99 | High-value, limited availability |

**How to Set Price:**
```
Profile → Edit Profile → Subscription Price
Choose: $4.99 to $49.99
Save
```

**Price Changes:**
- Existing subscribers keep current price (grandfathered)
- New subscribers pay new price
- You can run promotions (discounted trials)

### Subscription Analytics

**Track your subscription performance:**

Dashboard → Subscriptions

**Key Metrics:**

**Active Subscribers:**
- Total number currently subscribed
- Trend (growing/declining)
- By subscription tier (if you have multiple)

**MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):**
- Total monthly recurring revenue
- Predictable income you can count on
- Example: 100 subs × $9.99 = $999/month

**Churn Rate:**
- % of subscribers who cancel each month
- Target: <10% monthly churn
- High churn = need to improve content/engagement

**Lifetime Value (LTV):**
- Average total revenue per subscriber over their lifetime
- Calculation: Avg subscription price ÷ Churn rate
- Example: $9.99 ÷ 0.10 = $99.90 LTV

**Renewal Rate:**
- % of subscriptions that renew successfully
- Target: >90%
- Failed renewals = expired credit cards, insufficient funds

### Subscription Promotions

**Free Trials:**
```
Profile → Promotions → Create Free Trial

```

**Discounted Trials:**

### How Refunds Affect You

**When refund issued:**
1. Amount deducted from your balance
2. If already paid out, negative balance created
3. Negative balance deducted from future earnings
4. You receive notification

**Example:**
```
November 15 payout: $500 (sent to your bank)
November 20: Fan refunded $50

Your account:
- Balance: -$50
- Next payout (Nov 30): Earn $300
- Deduct negative: -$50
- Actual payout: $250
```

### Chargebacks

**What is a chargeback?**
- Fan disputes charge with credit card company
- Claims: Unauthorized, fraud, not as described
- Card company reverses charge
- More serious than refund

**Chargeback Process:**

1. **Fan files dispute** with their bank
2. **Bank notifies us** (2-8 weeks after purchase)

- Deducted from your earnings
- Industry standard, covers processing costs

**High Chargebacks = Problem:**
