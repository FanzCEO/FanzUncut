## <a name="understanding"></a>💡 Understanding Subscriptions

### What are Subscriptions?

Subscriptions are **monthly recurring payments** from fans for exclusive access to your content.

**How it works:**
1. Fan pays monthly subscription fee (e.g., $9.99/month)
2. They get access to subscriber-only content
3. They're automatically charged each month
4. You earn **80% of subscription revenue**
5. They can cancel anytime

**Example:**
```
You set price: $9.99/month
Fan subscribes: Charged $9.99 on day 1
You earn: $7.99 (80%)
Platform: $2.00 (20%)

Day 30: Fan auto-charged $9.99 again
Day 60: Fan auto-charged $9.99 again
...continues until they cancel
```

### Subscription vs One-Time Purchases

| Subscription | PPV/Tips |
|-------------|----------|
| **Recurring** monthly revenue | **One-time** payment |
| **Predictable** income | **Variable** income |
| Access to **all** subscriber content | Access to **specific** post only |
| **Builds** long-term fans | **Attracts** casual viewers |
| **Stable** earnings | **Fluctuating** earnings |

**Best strategy:** Combine both!
- Subscriptions = reliable base income
- PPV/Tips = bonus earnings

### What Subscribers Get

- ✅ All subscriber-only posts
- ✅ Subscriber-only live streams
- ✅ Direct messaging access (if enabled)
- ✅ Exclusive content library
- ✅ Behind-the-scenes updates
- ✅ Community access

**NOT included (charge separately):**

## <a name="analytics"></a>📊 Subscription Analytics

### Key Metrics

**Dashboard → Analytics → Subscriptions**

**1. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**
```

Example: 100 subs × $9.99 = $999 MRR
You earn: $799.20 (80%)
```

**2. Total Active Subscribers**
```
Current paying subscribers
Growth trend (↑ or ↓)
```

**3. New Subscribers (This Month)**
```
New subs gained this month
Acquisition rate
```

**4. Churn Rate**
```
% of subscribers who cancel each month
Formula: Cancellations ÷ Total Subs × 100
Target: <10% monthly churn
```

**5. Renewal Rate**
```
% of subscriptions that renew successfully
Target: >90%
Failed renewals = expired cards, insufficient funds
```

**6. Average Subscription Length**
```
How long subscribers stay (on average)
Example: 3.5 months average
```

**7. Lifetime Value (LTV)**
```
Average total revenue per subscriber over their lifetime

Example: $9.99 ÷ 0.10 = $99.90 LTV
```

**8. Net New Subscribers**
```
New subs - Cancellations
Example: 15 new - 5 cancelled = +10 net new
```
