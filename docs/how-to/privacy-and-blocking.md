---

## Restricting Users

### Restrict vs Block

**Restrict** = Softer approach
- They can still see your content
- But interactions are limited
- They don't know they're restricted

**Block** = Complete cutoff
- They can't see anything
- No interaction possible
- Your choice

### What Restricting Does

When you restrict someone:

**They CAN:**
- ✅ View your profile
- ✅ See your posts
- ✅ Remain subscribed

**BUT:**
- ⚠️ Their comments only visible to them (you can approve to show publicly)
- ⚠️ Their messages go to requests folder (not main inbox)
- ⚠️ You don't get notifications of their activity
- ⚠️ They can't see when you're online
- ⚠️ They can't see if you've read their messages

**Best For:**
- Overly chatty but not harmful users
- Clingy but paying subscribers
- Awkward situations (acquaintances)
- Testing before blocking

### How to Restrict Someone

1. Go to user's profile
2. Click menu icon (⋮)
3. Select **Restrict**
4. Confirm

**Unrestrict:**
Same process, select **Unrestrict**

---

## Geographic Restrictions

### Blocking by Location

Prevent users from specific regions from accessing your content.

**Common Uses:**
- Block your home country (privacy)
- Block where family/friends live
- Block prohibited jurisdictions
- Reduce unwanted attention from specific regions

### Setting Geographic Blocks

**Settings → Privacy & Safety → Geographic Restrictions**

```
BLOCK BY LOCATION

Block Entire Countries:
[+] Add Country

Currently Blocked:
🇺🇸 United States - [Remove]
🇨🇦 Canada - [Remove]
🇬🇧 United Kingdom - [Remove]

Block Specific Regions/States:
[+] Add Region

Currently Blocked:
📍 California, USA - [Remove]
📍 Texas, USA - [Remove]
```

**How It Works:**
- Based on IP address location
- Users see: "This profile is not available in your region"
- Applies to profile, all content, search results

**Important Notes:**
- VPNs can bypass geographic blocks
- Not 100% foolproof
- Combine with other privacy measures
- May reduce potential subscriber base

### Block Home Location

**Protect Local Privacy:**

```
MY LOCATION PRIVACY

My Location: [New York, USA ▼]

Block Radius:
( ) 10 miles
( ) 25 miles
(•) 50 miles
( ) 100 miles
( ) Custom

This blocks anyone whose IP shows they're within 50 miles of New York, USA.
```

**Use Case:**
"I don't want anyone who lives near me finding my content."

## Profile Privacy

**Switch to Private:**

**What Happens:**

## Safety Best Practices

### Creating Safe Boundaries

**Communication Boundaries:**

```
MY BOUNDARIES (Example)

✅ I WILL:
- Reply to messages within 24 hours
- Engage with comments
- Accept custom requests within my guidelines
- Be friendly and professional

❌ I WON'T:
- Meet in person
- Share personal contact info
- Move conversations off-platform
- Discuss my real identity
- Share my location
- Video call with subscribers
```

**Post This in Your Bio:**
> "I don't meet fans in person, share personal contact info, or chat off-platform. Please respect these boundaries! 💕"

### Recognizing Red Flags

**Warning Signs - Consider Blocking:**

🚩 **Asks for personal information repeatedly**
> "What's your real name?" "Where do you live?" "What's your phone number?"

🚩 **Wants to move off-platform**
> "Add me on WhatsApp" "Let's chat on Telegram" "Here's my phone number"

🚩 **Pushes boundaries**
> "Just one meet-up" "I'll pay extra for your number" "Send me a real photo"

🚩 **Obsessive behavior**
> Messages 50 times/day, mentions you constantly, tracks your online status

🚩 **Threatening or aggressive**
> "You'll regret this" "I know where you live" "I'll find you"

🚩 **Financial manipulation**
> "I'll subscribe if you..." "Send me free content first" "I'll tip big next time"

🚩 **Tries to doxx you**
> Posts your real name, shares your location, threatens to expose you

**ACTION:** Block immediately, report to platform, document everything.

### Two-Factor Authentication

**Enable 2FA:**

```
Settings → Security → Two-Factor Authentication

Authentication Method:
(•) Authenticator App (recommended)
    (Authy, Google Authenticator)
( ) SMS Text Message
( ) Email

Backup Codes:
[Generate Backup Codes]
(Save these somewhere safe!)
```

**Why 2FA Matters:**
- Protects your account from hacking
- Secures your earnings
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Required for large payouts
