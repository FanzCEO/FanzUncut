---

### Managing Difficult Fans

**Problem:** Rude or demanding comments

**Response Options:**

**1. Ignore (Soft Approach)**
- Don't feed negativity
- Focus on positive fans

**2. Polite Redirect**
- "I appreciate your feedback, but let's keep it positive!"
- Set boundaries firmly but kindly

**3. Delete Comment**
- For inappropriate comments
- Click ⋯ → Delete

**4. Restrict User**
- Limits their visibility without full block
- Comments go to "pending"
- Messages to "requests"

**5. Block User**
- For harassment or repeated violations
- Complete cutoff
- Subscription canceled

---

**Problem:** Fan sharing screenshots of private content

**Actions:**
1. Message them directly: "Please don't share my content"
2. If continues, block and report
3. Issue DMCA takedown if shared publicly
4. Add watermarks to future content

**Prevention:**
- Watermark all content
- State clearly in bio: "No sharing"
- Use platform's content protection features

---

**Problem:** Fans asking for free content

**Response Template:**

"I appreciate your interest! My subscription includes [list benefits]. I put a lot of work into my content, and the subscription helps me keep creating high-quality posts for you. Thank you for understanding! 💕"

**Stay Firm:**
- Don't devalue your work
- Free content = less perceived value
- Occasional free teaser OK, but not regular practice

---

### Re-Engaging Inactive Fans

**Identify Inactive Fans:**
Dashboard → Fans → **Inactive** (Haven't viewed posts in 14+ days)

**Re-Engagement Campaign:**

**Day 1: Gentle Check-In**

"I've posted some great new content you might have missed! Here's a sneak peek... [thumbnail]"

**Day 7: Special Offer**

**Day 14: Last Chance**
"I'd love to have you back! Let me know if there's anything I can do to improve your experience."
