## Understanding Custom Requests

### What Are Custom Requests?

Custom requests allow fans to pay you to create specific content tailored to their preferences.

**How It Works:**

4. **Fan Pays**: Payment is held in escrow
5. **You Create**: Deliver the content within agreed timeframe

## Common Issues

### Problem: Too Many Requests

**Issue**: Overwhelmed with custom request volume

**Solutions:**
1. Raise your prices (reduces volume, increases profit)
2. Limit concurrent requests (max 3 at a time)
3. Close requests periodically (open/close schedule)
4. Increase delivery timeframes (7-14 days)

### Problem: Lowball Offers

**Issue**: Fans offering unreasonably low prices

**Solutions:**
1. Set minimum request price (blocks low offers)
2. Post your starting rates publicly
3. Use counter offer with explanation
4. Decline and provide rate sheet

**Template Response:**
> "Thanks for your interest! My base rate for custom videos is $100 for 3 minutes. I'd be happy to create this for you at that rate. Let me know!"

### Problem: Unclear Requests

**Issue**: Request is vague or confusing

**Solutions:**
1. Ask specific questions before accepting
2. Request detailed description
3. Offer to jump on brief call/message
4. Create questionnaire for common requests

**Questions to Ask:**
- What specific outfits/props?
- What location/setting?
- What should I say/do?
- Any names to mention?
- Preferred length?
- Hard deadline?

### Problem: Scope Creep

**Issue**: Fan keeps adding requirements after you accepted

**Solutions:**
1. Refer to original request description
2. Offer to create additional content for added fee
3. Set clear revision policy upfront
4. Use contracts for high-value requests ($500+)

**Template Response:**
> "I'm happy to create what we originally discussed. The new elements you mentioned would be a separate request. I can do both - let me know if you'd like me to send a quote for the additional content!"

### Problem: Missed Deadlines

**Issue**: You can't deliver on time

**Solutions:**
1. Communicate EARLY (as soon as you know)
2. Offer options: extend deadline or partial refund
3. Provide progress update
4. Learn from it - set longer timeframes next time

**Communication Template:**
> "Hi! I want to give you an update on your custom request. I'm running a bit behind schedule due to [brief reason]. I can have this ready for you in 2 more days, or if you prefer, I can process a refund. I'm sorry for the delay and really appreciate your patience!"

### Problem: Fan Disputes Delivery

**Issue**: Fan says content doesn't match request

**Solutions:**
1. Review original request together
2. Show how you met requirements
3. Offer minor revisions if reasonable
4. Contact platform support if needed

**Prevention:**
- Screenshot original request
- Confirm details before creating
- Over-communicate during process
- Document everything
