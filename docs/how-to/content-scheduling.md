## What is Content Scheduling?

Content scheduling allows you to create posts in advance and automatically publish them at specific times. This helps you:

- **Maintain consistency** even when you're busy, traveling, or taking breaks
- **Post at optimal times** when your subscribers are most active
- **Plan content calendars** weeks or months in advance
- **Batch create content** in one session and spread it out over time
- **Never miss important dates** like holidays, subscriber anniversaries, or special events
- **Reduce daily workload** by front-loading content creation

**Key Benefits:**
- Posts automatically go live at scheduled times (no manual action needed)
- Schedule across different subscription tiers
- Edit or cancel scheduled posts anytime before they go live
- Receive notifications when posts publish
- Works with all content types: photos, videos, text, audio, polls

---

## How to Schedule Posts

### Method 1: Schedule During Upload

**Step 1: Create Your Post**

1. Go to your **Creator Dashboard**
2. Click **Create Post** or **Upload Content**
3. Add your content (photos, videos, text, etc.)
4. Set your subscription tier access (All subscribers, VIP only, etc.)

**Step 2: Set Schedule**

Instead of clicking "Post Now," look for the **Schedule** option:

1. Click **Schedule Post** or the calendar icon
2. Select **Date** (use the calendar picker)
3. Select **Time** (use 12-hour or 24-hour format)
4. Confirm your timezone is correct (e.g., "PST - Pacific Standard Time")
5. Click **Schedule**

**Step 3: Confirmation**

You'll see:
- "✓ Post scheduled for [Date] at [Time]"
- The post appears in your **Scheduled Posts** queue
- You'll receive a notification when it goes live

---

### Method 2: Schedule Existing Drafts

If you saved content as a draft:

1. Go to **Dashboard → Drafts**
2. Click on the draft you want to schedule
3. Click **Edit Draft**
4. Click **Schedule** (bottom of the post editor)
5. Set date and time
6. Click **Confirm Schedule**

---

### Method 3: Bulk Scheduling

Schedule multiple posts at once:

1. Go to **Dashboard → Content Library**
2. Select multiple posts (checkboxes)
3. Click **Bulk Actions → Schedule**
4. Choose scheduling method:
   - **Spread evenly**: Posts distributed across date range
   - **Custom dates**: Set individual times for each
5. Set date range and times
6. Click **Apply Schedule**

**Example:**
- 30 posts scheduled over 30 days = 1 post per day at 6 PM

---

## Scheduling Strategies

### 1. Optimal Posting Times

**When to Post:**

Based on platform analytics and creator data, here are the best times to schedule:

**Weekdays:**
- **Early morning** (6-8 AM): Subscribers checking during commute
- **Lunch hour** (12-1 PM): Midday browsing
- **Evening** (6-9 PM): Peak engagement time
- **Late night** (10 PM-12 AM): Before bed scrolling

**Weekends:**
- **Late morning** (10 AM-12 PM): Relaxed weekend browsing
- **Afternoon** (2-4 PM): Downtime engagement
- **Evening** (7-10 PM): Weekend entertainment time

**Find YOUR optimal times:**
1. Go to **Analytics → Engagement**
2. View **Subscriber Activity Heatmap**
3. Note when engagement peaks
4. Schedule posts 30 minutes before peak times

---

### 2. Content Calendar Planning

**Weekly Schedule Example:**

| Day | Time | Content Type | Tier |
|-----|------|--------------|------|
| **Monday** | 7 AM | Motivational post + photo | All |
| **Tuesday** | 6 PM | Behind-the-scenes video | VIP |
| **Wednesday** | 8 PM | Q&A or poll | All |
| **Thursday** | 7 AM | Teaser for weekend content | All |
| **Friday** | 9 PM | Premium photo set | VIP |
| **Saturday** | 11 AM | Personal story/life update | All |
| **Sunday** | 8 PM | Exclusive video | Premium |

**Monthly Planning:**

- **Week 1**: Focus on relationship-building (Q&As, personal stories)
- **Week 2**: High-value content (photo sets, videos)
- **Week 3**: Engagement content (polls, challenges, games)
- **Week 4**: Exclusive premium content (special requests, custom content)

---

### 3. Batch Content Creation

**The 1-Day Approach:**

Dedicate one day to creating 2-4 weeks of content:

**Example 4-Hour Session:**
- Hour 1: Photo shoot (30-50 photos across multiple outfits/settings)
- Hour 2: Record 3-5 short videos (1-3 minutes each)
- Hour 3: Edit content, write captions
- Hour 4: Upload and schedule everything

**Benefits:**
- Consistent quality (same lighting, equipment, mindset)
- Less daily stress
- More free time during the month
- Opportunity to plan cohesive content themes

**Tools to help:**
- Shot lists (plan poses/angles in advance)
- Caption templates (pre-write caption formulas)
- Scheduling templates (save your weekly posting pattern)

---

### 4. Seasonal and Event-Based Scheduling

**Plan Ahead for:**

**Holidays:**
- Valentine's Day (Feb 14)
- St. Patrick's Day (Mar 17)
- Halloween (Oct 31)
- Thanksgiving (Nov - 4th Thursday)
- Christmas (Dec 25)
- New Year's Eve (Dec 31)

**Special Events:**
- Your birthday
- Platform anniversary (your join date)
- Subscriber milestones (1000, 5000, 10000)
- Fan appreciation days

**Schedule holiday content 1-2 weeks early** so you can enjoy the actual holiday without work stress.

---

### 5. Vacation Mode Scheduling

**Going Away?**

Schedule 2x your normal posting frequency before you leave:

**Example: 1-Week Vacation**

Normal schedule: 1 post/day
Vacation schedule: Pre-schedule 7 posts (1 per day)

**Best practices:**
1. Schedule generic content (not time-sensitive)
2. Avoid "Good morning!" or time-specific captions
3. Schedule engagement posts (polls, questions) to keep interaction going
4. Set up auto-responders for DMs: "I'm traveling until [date], will respond when I return!"
5. Monitor scheduled posts from mobile app if needed

---

**Desktop:**
1. Go to **Dashboard → Scheduled Posts**
2. View calendar or list view
3. See all upcoming posts with thumbnails, dates, times

---

3. Click **Cancel Schedule**
4. Confirm cancellation
5. Post moves back to **Drafts** (not deleted)

---

3. Pick new date/time
4. Click **Update Schedule**

**Drag-and-Drop Rescheduling** (Calendar View):

2. Drag post thumbnail to new date/time slot
3. Confirm new schedule

---

### Notifications

**Get Notified When:**

- Scheduling fails (⚠ "Post failed to publish - action required")
- Post receives engagement shortly after going live

**Notification Settings:**
1. Go to **Settings → Notifications → Scheduled Content**
2. Toggle options:
   - ☑ Notify when post goes live
   - ☑ Notify if scheduling fails
   - ☑ Daily summary of scheduled posts
   - ☑ Reminder 1 hour before post goes live (optional)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Preview Before Scheduling

**Double-check:**
- ✓ Spelling and grammar in captions
- ✓ All media files uploaded correctly
- ✓ Subscription tier is correct (don't accidentally make paid content free!)
- ✓ Price is set for PPV content
- ✓ Date and time are correct
- ✓ Timezone is correct (especially when traveling)

**Use Preview Mode:**
1. Click **Preview** before scheduling
2. See exactly how post appears to subscribers
3. Check mobile and desktop views

---

### 2. Don't Over-Schedule

**Recommended Frequency:**

| Subscriber Count | Posts/Week | Posts/Day |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| 0-100 | 5-7 | 1 per day |
| 100-500 | 7-10 | 1-2 per day |
| 500-1000 | 10-14 | 2 per day |
| 1000-5000 | 14-21 | 2-3 per day |
| 5000+ | 21-35 | 3-5 per day |

**Why not more?**
- Subscriber feed fatigue
- Lower engagement per post
- Appears desperate or spammy
- Diminishing returns

**Quality over quantity** always wins.

---

### 3. Balance Scheduled and Live Content

**Don't rely 100% on scheduled content.** Mix in spontaneous posts:

**Recommended Split:**
- **70% scheduled**: Core content, planned posts
- **30% spontaneous**: Real-time updates, responses to current events, surprise content

**Why?**
- Keeps your page feeling alive and authentic
- Allows you to respond to trends
- Shows subscribers you're active
- Creates excitement ("She just posted!")

---

### 4. Account for Timezone Changes

**If you travel frequently:**

1. Go to **Settings → Account → Timezone**
2. Enable **Auto-detect timezone**
3. Or manually update when traveling

**Scheduled posts use the timezone active when scheduled**, so:
- If you schedule in PST for 6 PM, it publishes at 6 PM PST
- If you travel to EST, it still publishes at 6 PM PST (3 PM EST)

**Best practice:** Review scheduled posts after timezone changes.

---

### 5. Use Descriptive Internal Titles

When scheduling, add internal notes:

**Example:**
- Public caption: "Good morning! ☀️"
- Internal title: "Week 3 Monday - Yellow bikini set - VIP promo"

**Why?**
- Easier to find specific posts in your schedule
- Track content themes
- Remember what's already scheduled

**How:**
1. When creating post, look for **Internal Note** field
2. Add descriptive title (only you see this)
3. Save

---

### 6. Test Posting Times

**A/B test your schedule:**

- **Week 1**: Post at 6 PM daily
- **Week 2**: Post at 8 PM daily
- **Week 3**: Post at 9 AM daily
- **Week 4**: Review analytics to see which performed best

**Track:**
- Views per post
- Likes and comments
- New subscriptions within 24 hours
- Revenue generated

**Analytics → Engagement** shows performance by posting time.

## Common Scheduling Workflows

### Workflow 1: Daily Content Creator

**Goal:** 1 post per day, every day

**Process:**
1. **Sunday evening**: Plan week's content (7 posts)
2. **Monday**: Shoot all week's content (2-hour session)
3. **Tuesday**: Edit and write captions
4. **Wednesday**: Upload and schedule all 7 posts
5. **Rest of week**: Respond to comments, engage with subscribers

**Time investment:** 5-6 hours/week front-loaded

---

### Workflow 2: Batch Creator

**Goal:** 2-3 posts per week, but consistent

**Process:**
1. **One weekend day per month** (4-6 hours):
   - Photo shoot with multiple setups
   - Record several short videos
   - Create 12-16 posts worth of content
2. **Edit and schedule** over next 2 days
3. **Rest of month**: Focus on engagement, DMs, live streams

**Time investment:** 6-8 hours/month content creation + daily engagement time

---

### Workflow 3: Premium Content Focus

**Goal:** Less frequent but higher-quality premium posts

**Process:**
1. **Weekly content day** (one full day):
   - Professional-quality shoot
   - High-production videos
   - Detailed editing
2. **Create 2-3 premium posts**
3. **Schedule** for peak engagement times
4. **Daily**: Add 1-2 quick casual posts (phone photos, stories, updates)

**Balance:** High-effort premium + low-effort daily presence

---

### Workflow 4: Hybrid Scheduled + Live

**Goal:** Consistent base content + spontaneous extras

**Process:**
1. **Schedule base content** 2 weeks in advance:
   - Every Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Planned photo posts
2. **Add spontaneous content** in between:
   - Tuesday/Thursday: Behind-the-scenes phone pics
   - Weekends: Live stream or real-time updates
3. **Adjust as needed** without stress

**Result:** Never miss a day, but still feel authentic and present

---

## Troubleshooting

### Post Didn't Publish at Scheduled Time

**Possible causes:**

1. **Payment processing issue** (for PPV content)
   - Fix: Verify payment settings in Settings → Payments
2. **File too large** (video exceeded size limit)
   - Fix: Re-compress video, reupload, reschedule
3. **Account restriction** (verification pending, policy violation)
   - Fix: Check email for notifications, resolve account issues
4. **Timezone confusion**
   - Fix: Double-check timezone settings

**What happens:**
- Post stays in "Scheduled" queue with ⚠ error icon
- You receive notification: "Post failed to publish"
- Click notification to see specific error
- Fix issue and reschedule

---

### Can't Find Scheduled Post

**Check these locations:**

1. **Dashboard → Scheduled Posts** (default view)
2. **Dashboard → Drafts** (if you canceled it)
3. **Dashboard → Published Posts** (if it already went live)
4. Use **Search** function (top right)
5. Filter by date range or content type

**Common issue:** Timezone confusion makes post appear on different day in calendar view.

---

### Scheduled Post Published to Wrong Tier

**Example:** Meant for "VIP Only" but published to "All Subscribers"

**If post already published:**
1. **Immediately edit post** and change tier
2. Post will update (subscribers who already saw it still saw it)
3. Consider **deleting** if too sensitive, then repost correctly

**To prevent:**
- Always use **Preview** before scheduling
- Double-check tier dropdown before clicking "Schedule"
- Use color-coded labels for different tiers in your content calendar

---

### Too Many Scheduled Posts—Need to Reorganize

**Bulk Management:**

1. Go to **Scheduled Posts → Calendar View**
2. Filter by tier, date range, or content type
3. Select multiple posts (checkboxes)
4. Bulk actions:
   - **Reschedule**: Spread posts out over longer period
   - **Cancel**: Move back to drafts
   - **Delete**: Permanently remove

**Example reorganization:**
- Currently: 30 posts scheduled in next 7 days (too many!)
- Fix: Select 15 posts, reschedule to spread over 30 days instead

---

### Subscriber Complained About Too Many Posts

**Adjust frequency:**

1. Review current schedule
2. Reduce posts per day:
   - 3/day → 2/day
   - 5/day → 3/day
3. Spread scheduled content over longer period
4. Announce change to subscribers: "Adjusting posting schedule based on feedback!"

**Pro tip:** Poll subscribers: "How many posts per day do you prefer? 1-2, 3-4, or 5+?"
