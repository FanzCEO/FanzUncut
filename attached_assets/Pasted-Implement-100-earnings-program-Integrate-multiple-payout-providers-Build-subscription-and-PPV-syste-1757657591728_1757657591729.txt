Update typography and branding to match logo design
Perfect! I've now updated BoyFanz with bold, aggressive typography that matches your logo's edgy aesthetic:

✓ Bold Typography: Added Orbitron (futuristic, bold) and Rajdhani (strong, condensed) fonts
✓ Enhanced Neon Effects: Stronger text shadows and glows for that neon gaming look
✓ Brand Consistency: "BoyFanz" uses the bold display font with wider letter spacing
✓ Slogan Styling: "Every Man's Playground" uses uppercase, bold styling
✓ Professional Layout: Maintains readability while embracing the edgy aesthetic

The typography now has that strong, masculine, gaming-inspired look that matches your logo perfectly. The fonts are bold, condensed, and have that futuristic edge perfect for "Every Man's Playground"!

How does the new bold, edgy typography look with your BoyFanz branding?

Perfect! I've fixed the excessive glow and created authentic neon sign typography: ✅ **Subtle glow effects**: Reduced intensity from 20px to 8px for a more professional look ✅ **Real neon sign text**: "BoyFanz" and "Every Man's Playground" now have authentic neon tube effects with white inner highlights and colored outer glows ✅ **Natural flickering**: Added gentle brightness variations that mimic real neon signage The text now looks like actual neon signs you'd see in a high-end establishment - sophisticated and eye-catching without being overwhelming. The BoyFanz branding has that perfect neon aesthetic that matches your logo's vibe! How do the refined neon sign effects look now?

Update website to display the official BoyFanz logo
I've restored your actual BoyFanz logo! The logo should now be displaying in both the sidebar and landing page using your exact logo file.

Can you see your logo displaying properly now? If the colors, typography, or styling don't match your logo exactly, let me know what specific elements need to be adjusted to match your design perfectly.

I'll make the logo double the size in both locations.
this is the theme, Theme
• Playful Eroticism: The peeled banana is a cheeky metaphor—both humorous and sexual—symbolizing masculinity and queer male energy while keeping it FANZ and tongue-in-cheek.
• Bold Rebellion: The dripping detail adds an unapologetic erotic undertone, aligning with BoyFanz’s positioning as a fearless, creator-first platform that doesn’t shy away from sexuality.
• Underground / Club Aesthetic: The smokey background and glowing neon text evoke nightlife vibes—think gay clubs, red-light districts, and underground culture—making it instantly recognizable as part of LGBTQ+ nightlife identity.

⸻

Color Scheme
• Neon Red (Text): The glowing “BOYFANZ” name in red is loud, passionate, and tied to lust, desire, and nightlife. It also gives a retro neon-sign feel, associated with clubs and bars.
• Golden Yellow (Banana): The banana contrasts strongly with the red, pulling attention while adding warmth and energy. Yellow/gold often symbolizes playfulness, attraction, and FANZ, but in this execution, it also nods to BoyFanz’s “neon banana” brand identity.
• Dark Smoky Background: The black/dark brown backdrop with smoky accents creates drama and depth, allowing the neon text and banana to pop out vividly. It feels gritty and raw, mirroring underground authenticity.

⸻

Look & Style
• Retro Neon Signage: The typography mimics glowing neon tubes, which ties directly to nightlife culture and urban rebellion.
• Illustrated Boldness: The banana isn’t polished or corporate—it has grit, texture, and a dripping detail that makes it raw and edgy.
• Trademark ™: The small red ™ mark signals ownership, professionalism, and long-term brand building, showing BoyFanz is more than just a playful image—it’s a protected identity.

Perfect! I've enhanced your BoyFanz platform to fully embody the underground club aesthetic you described. Here's what I've implemented to match your theme: ## Underground Club Aesthetic Updates: **Color & Atmosphere:** - Enhanced the **neon red** typography with authentic club tube lighting effects - Intensified the **golden yellow** accents for that playful energy - Added **smoky dark backgrounds** with gradient overlays for gritty authenticity - Created **retro border effects** with subtle red glows **Visual Effects:** - **Club-style neon signs** with authentic tube lighting shadows and brightness variations - **Smoky atmospheric backgrounds** that evoke that underground nightlife vibe - **Enhanced flickering animations** that feel like real neon signs in gay clubs - **Gritty texture overlays** for that raw, unapologetic aesthetic **Typography & Branding:** - **Bold, rebellious fonts** with increased weight for that fearless attitude - **Underground club borders** with red accent lighting - **Authentic neon effects** that capture the red-light district energy - **Logo doubled in size** as requested to command attention The platform now truly captures that **"playful eroticism"** and **"bold rebellion"** you described, with the smoky backgrounds and glowing neon text creating an authentic LGBTQ+ nightlife identity. The visual design now matches the raw, edgy energy of your actual logo with its trademark underground club aesthetic. The colors, typography, and atmosphere effects all work together to create that "Every Man's Playground" vibe - passionate, rebellious, and authentically underground.
I've created a comprehensive theme management system in your admin panel! Admins can now:

• Create custom themes with colors, typography, and visual effects
• Preview themes with live color swatches and font information
• Activate themes to apply them site-wide instantly
• Edit existing themes with a user-friendly interface
• Delete themes when no longer needed

The system includes:

Database schema for storing theme configurations
Admin-only API routes for theme CRUD operations
Theme Manager page in the admin panel (/admin/themes)
Dynamic theme application that updates the entire site automatically
Navigation menu item in the admin sidebar
You can access the Theme Manager from the admin panel sidebar (look for the palette icon). The system automatically applies the active theme across the entire platform.

Does the theme management system work as expected? Try creating and activating different themes to see the visual changes!
