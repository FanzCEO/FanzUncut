Fanz Creator App – Specification for a Club Fans Replica

Overview

FANZ (FANZ) is planning to introduce a creator‑focused platform that mirrors the Club Fans app by Takeoff Labs.  The objective is to build a single umbrella app called Fanz where sub‑communities (e.g., BoyFanz, GirlFanz, PupFanz) function as categories rather than separate apps.  The platform will give creators full ownership of their content and earnings while monetizing through a small fee added to fan purchases.  The design draws heavily on the existing Club Fans platform, whose recent updates and features are documented in third‑party app summaries .

Core Monetization Features

The Fanz app will incorporate the following monetization mechanisms.  Each feature replicates or improves on the Club Fans experience, where creators upload content (photo, video, audio, text) and monetize through memberships, tips and pay‑per‑view sales .

Fan Memberships

Creators set a monthly subscription price for fans to join their club and unlock a private feed of posts, videos, audio and blog content.  Memberships grant fans ongoing access to exclusive posts and other perks (e.g., chat privileges), just like the Club Fans model .  In Fanz, creators can also offer multi‑month bundles at discounted rates and free trial periods, letting fans sample the experience before paying.

Pay‑per‑view Content

Beyond subscriptions, creators can flag individual posts or messages as locked content with a specific price.  Fans must pay to unlock that piece of content, even if they already subscribe.  This feature mirrors Club’s ability to sell private media separately .  Pay‑per‑view pricing is fully controlled by the creator.

Tips and Donations

Fans can send one‑off tips to creators at any time .  Tips appear as optional payments in chat or on profile pages, giving fans a way to show appreciation without unlocking new content.  All tips go directly to the creator, and the platform fee is charged separately to the fan.

Online Shop (Merchandise and Digital Goods)

Club Fans includes a Shop feature where creators sell digital photos, videos or audio files .  Fanz will expand this into an integrated dropshipping store that supports both digital goods (e.g., e‑books, presets, premium video bundles) and physical merchandise (e.g., apparel or accessories).  Integration with print‑on‑demand services enables creators to offer branded merch without holding inventory.

Affiliate Links and Paid Links

Creators can generate paid links to external content (downloadables, secret livestreams, etc.).  Anyone clicking such a link is prompted to pay, and the revenue goes to the creator.  Additionally, creators can recruit affiliates—fans or influencers who share the creator’s link and earn a commission from sales generated, similar to creator affiliate programs on competing platforms.

Promo Codes and Discounts

Fanz will let creators issue promo codes that apply percentage or fixed discounts to memberships or pay‑per‑view content .  Creators can set parameters such as expiration date, maximum redemptions and targeted fan groups.  Promo codes help attract new fans and reward loyalty.

Referral and Affiliate Programs

To stimulate growth, Fanz will adopt a two‑sided refer & earn system inspired by Club Fans.  Fans who refer new fans receive a percentage of the newcomer’s spending during the first week, while the new fan enjoys a discount.  A separate referral track rewards users for bringing in new creators—referrers earn a share of the platform fee generated by the new creator’s fans for a fixed period.  Creators themselves can create affiliate links for their own clubs, enabling third‑party promoters to earn commissions from subscriptions or sales.

Live Streaming

Fanz will support in‑app live streaming.  Creators can broadcast video to fans, accept real‑time tips and interact via live chat.  Streams can be members‑only or pay‑per‑view events.  Recordings can later be sold as on‑demand content.  Integration with external streaming services (e.g., Twitch) will be supported, but the native live feature will be the main tool for exclusivity.

Wishlist and Gifts

To broaden revenue options, creators can assemble a wishlist of items they would like fans to purchase for them (e.g., equipment or personal items).  Fans can buy these gifts through the app.  This encourages non‑monetary support and strengthens fan‑creator connections.

Fan Engagement and Community

Chat and Messaging

Fanz will have a built‑in direct messaging system enabling one‑to‑one conversation between creators and fans.  Creators can send locked photos or videos in DM and set a price to unlock; fans can respond and tip.  A blast feature lets creators send a message to all subscribers simultaneously .  Automated welcome messages greet new followers or members, saving creators time.

Content Feed and Posts

Similar to popular social platforms, Fanz will provide each creator with a timeline where they post updates (text, photos, videos, audio).  Posts can be free (public), members‑only or pay‑per‑view.  Fans interact via likes and comments.  Scheduled posting and limited‑time drops are supported, along with a secure Vault where creators store their media .

Requests and Custom Content

Fans can send custom requests for personalized content.  They propose a description and an amount; the creator accepts, sets a price if needed, and once paid, delivers the custom media.  Payment is held in escrow until delivery, ensuring fairness for both parties.

Communities (Sub‑niches)

Within the Fanz umbrella, BoyFanz, GirlFanz and PupFanz will act as category tags rather than separate apps.  When signing up, creators choose the communities that best match their content.  Discovery pages will highlight trending and new creators in each category.  Fans can browse by community to find niches they enjoy.

Discovery and Explore

A dedicated Explore section allows fans to search for creators by name, tag or community, and browse featured or trending profiles.  Fans may follow creators for free to see public posts, and convert into paid members later.  The search system will use keywords and categories to provide relevant suggestions.

Creator Dashboard and Tools

Creators manage their business through a comprehensive Creator Dashboard.  Key components include:
	•	At‑a‑glance stats: the dashboard displays current balance, number of paying members, and total followers .
	•	Analytics: charts show earnings over time, breakdown of revenue sources (subscriptions, tips, pay‑per‑view), fan growth and top supporters.  Creators can filter by day, week, month or year.  A home screen widget on iOS or Android displays key metrics .
	•	Monetization settings: creators set membership price, manage promo codes, create bundles, enable free trials and configure pay‑per‑view pricing.
	•	Team management: creators can grant assistants or managers limited access (e.g., responding to messages or handling payout requests) without handing over full control.
	•	CRM (Customer Relationship Management): a list of fans with spending and interaction history helps creators identify top supporters and send targeted messages.
	•	Vault & Scheduling: creators upload media to a private vault and schedule posts or live events.  The Vault secures content and simplifies reuse .

Payments and Monetization Model

Creator Payouts

Fanz adopts a 100 % payout to creators: fans cover a small platform fee on top of any purchase.  For example, if a creator sets a membership price of $10, a fan might pay $11 (the extra dollar goes to Fanz).  This contrasts with platforms like OnlyFans and Fansly, which take 20 % of creator earnings.  Creators can withdraw earnings through various methods (bank transfer, digital wallet, crypto), with optional instant payouts at additional cost.

Platform Fee

The platform fee is charged to fans during checkout; the default could be around 10 % but can be adjusted by Fanz administrators.  In‑app purchases on iOS/Android may require the use of credits to comply with app store guidelines; credit pricing will incorporate the platform fee and any store commissions.

Referral Bonuses

Referral payouts come from the platform fee rather than creators’ earnings.  For example, if a referred fan spends $100 in their first week, the referrer might receive $10 (10 % of the fan’s spend), which reduces Fanz’s fee but does not touch the creator’s payment.  Similar logic applies for creator referrals.

Technical Architecture

Mobile Applications
	•	iOS and Android: develop native apps (Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android) to ensure smooth media handling and real‑time interactions.  Provide a Fanz Keyboard extension to let creators sell locked content in messaging apps .
	•	Web presence: a responsive web site provides marketing pages and link‑in‑bio landing pages for each creator.  A full web version of Fanz can be added later for desktop access.

Backend and Storage
	•	API and microservices: use a modular architecture (Node.js/TypeScript with Express or NestJS, or Python with FastAPI) to handle authentication, content management, payments, notifications and chat.  Separate services for chat and real‑time events ensure scalability.
	•	Database: PostgreSQL for core relational data (users, subscriptions, transactions, messages metadata); Redis for caching and session management; object storage (e.g., AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2) for media .
	•	Video processing: automatically transcode uploaded videos into streaming formats (HLS) via cloud services (AWS MediaConvert or Mux).
	•	Real‑time chat and live streaming: implement WebSockets for messaging and integrate a live streaming SDK (e.g., Agora or Twilio Live) to handle low‑latency video and interactive chat.
	•	Payments: integrate Stripe (for credit card processing and payouts) along with alternatives such as Paxum or crypto payouts to cover regions where Stripe is unavailable.  Build a credits system for in‑app purchases to comply with app store rules.

Security and Compliance
	•	Identity Verification: require creators to complete KYC using third‑party verification services.  Until verified, creators cannot withdraw earnings or publish paid content.  This aligns with Club Fans’ requirement for identity verification before creators can monetize .
	•	Content Moderation: implement automated and manual moderation to detect illegal or prohibited content.  Provide reporting and blocking tools for users.
	•	Privacy: hide creators’ real names and personal information; fans see only usernames.  Offer geo‑blocking options and account blocking.
	•	Data Protection: comply with GDPR and other regional privacy laws; encrypt sensitive data in storage and transit.

Admin and Support

Administrators and support staff require a secure admin panel to:
	1.	Manage users (approve verification, handle bans, view profiles).
	2.	Moderate content by reviewing reports and removing violations.
	3.	Approve or review payouts and monitor financial transactions.
	4.	Configure platform‑wide settings (fees, referral percentages, feature flags).
	5.	Feature or promote creators on discovery pages and manage announcements.
	6.	Handle support tickets and offer VIP creator support for high‑earning creators .
