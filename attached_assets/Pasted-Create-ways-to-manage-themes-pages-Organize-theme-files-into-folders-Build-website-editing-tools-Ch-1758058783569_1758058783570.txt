✅ Seductive Neon Effects Complete!
I've successfully transformed the BoyFanz landing page with that provocative underground club aesthetic you wanted:

🔥 Crimson Red Neon Headings
Weathered & Damaged: All headings now have seductive crimson red neon with realistic burn marks and crack patterns
Erotic Flickering: 18-second animation cycle with dramatic burn-outs and sultry dimming that creates that "horny" vibe
Underground Club Feel: Heavy contrast and saturated colors that pulse with sexual energy
💫 White Neon Body Text
Elegant Glow: All body text now has clean white neon effects with subtle pulsing
Perfect Contrast: The white neon creates beautiful contrast against the smoky background
🎭 Enhanced Atmosphere
Slowed Flickering: 12-15 second cycles for more realistic old neon sign timing
Accessibility: Motion-sensitive users get static effects
Authentic Damage: Multiple crack overlays and burn spots make the signs look genuinely weathered
The landing page now has that raw, seductive energy of a real underground club - with flickering crimson signs that would make anyone's pulse quicken and elegant white neon that draws you deeper into the experience. The "Every Man's Playground" golden tagline still glows with that dusty vintage effect we perfected earlier.

Diagnosed loading issue
Let me check what's causing the loading issue by examining the logs:
Checked console and system logs

Decided on authentication fix approach
I can see the issue! The app is stuck in an infinite authentication loop. The useAuth hook is repeatedly making requests to /api/auth/user, getting 401 errors, and then being rate limited. Let me fix this immediately:
