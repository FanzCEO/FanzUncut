alright Josh — here’s a no-BS, mega list of processors and rails that actually work with adult. i’m grouping them so you can plug + play across FANZ. nobody gets a free pass here: policies shift fast, so I’m flagging mainstream no-gos too.

# Core card processors/gateways (adult-first)

* CCBill. Global adult merchant accounts, cards + e-checks, strong risk + compliance. ([CCBill][1])
* Segpay. Adult/dating specialist, global acquiring, chargeback tools. ([Segpay][2])
* Epoch. Longtime adult subscription billing/IPSP, multi-currency, recurring. ([Corefy][3], [Paylobby][4])
* Verotel. Adult-friendly processing since the 90s; also offers US paper check payout option.
* Vendo Services. Gateway + acquiring for “content platforms, fan sites & cams,” with Pay-by-Bank options. ([Vendo][5])
* CommerceGate. EU acquiring for adult; risk + compliance guidance. ([CommerceGate][6])
* NETbilling. Adult/high-risk gateway; cards + ACH/e-checks.
* RocketGate. Enterprise adult billing gateway/acquirer routing.
* CentroBill. Adult subscription/paywall processing. ([Centrobill][7])
* VXS / VXSBill (VirtualXS). EU PSP with cards + iDEAL/SOFORT + phone billing. ([VXS][8])
* Inovio. Adult merchant accounts + gateway, PCI, recurring. ([Inoviopay][9])
* Truevo (select programs). Publicly markets payment solutions for adult/high-risk. (Due diligence required.) ([Truevo Payments][10])

# High-risk ISOs / facilitators that routinely place adult

* Corepay. Adult/high-risk merchant placement & MasterCard rules briefings. ([Corepay][11])
* PayKings. Adult merchant account programs. ([PayKings][12])
* PaymentCloud / SMB Global / Easy Pay Direct. High-risk desks with adult offerings. (Programs vary by sub-vertical.) ([Easy Pay Direct][13])
* MobiusPay. Awarded in adult categories; merchant services for adult. ([Wikipedia][14])
* Merchant advisors/brokers (UK/EU examples): Merchant Advice Service / Merchant Advice (adult). (Use for EU acquiring placement.) ([Merchant Advice][15], [Merchant Advice][16])

# Crypto payment gateways used by adult

* NOWPayments (explicit “Adult” solution pages; anonymous options; on/off-ramp support). ([NOWPayments][17])
* CoinsPaid / CryptoProcessing.com (enterprise crypto acquiring; adult compatible programs). ([CoinsPaid][18])
* B2BinPay (markets an “adult platforms” crypto gateway). ([B2BINPAY][19])
* CoinPayments (positions for high-risk incl. adult; check current AUP before go-live). ([CoinPayments Media][20])

# Payout e-wallets & mass-pay used across adult creator platforms

* Paxum. Adult-industry standard for creator payouts (won “Alternative Payment” at XBIZ). ([Wikipedia][14])
* CosmoPayment. Prepaid/Visa payout programs used by cam/creator sites (creator forums reference). ([Reddit][21])
* ePayService. Multi-rail payouts (cards/IBAN), widely used in entertainment & affiliate ecosystems. (Confirm current AUP per use case.) ([epayservices.com][22])
* i-Payout, MassPay. Mass disbursements (banks, cards, APMs) for marketplaces/UGC platforms. ([i-payout][23], [masspay.io][24])

# Bank transfer rails / e-checks (ACH/SEPA) that are adult-capable

* ACH / e-check via NETbilling (gateway option).
* Verotel “US Check” payout option. (Paper check issuance to US creators.)
* SEPA/Wires: available via most adult acquirers above (merchant settlement); confirm with each acquirer’s AUP & settlement corridors.

# Direct Carrier Billing (DCB) / telco-wallets (regional add-ons; adult acceptance varies by MNO and country)

* Bango, Boku, DIMOCO (carrier billing aggregators). Useful for soft-subscription upsells where allowed. (Always validate local carrier content policies.) ([Bango][25], [Nilson Report][26], [DIMOCO][27])

# Reality check — mainstream processors that are typically **not** OK for adult

* Stripe: adult content and services are on the restricted/prohibited list. ([Stripe Support][28], [Stripe][29])
* PayPal: bans digital adult content (e.g., VOD, cams) in AUP. ([PayPal][30])
* Coinbase Commerce: “Adult Content and Services” are listed as prohibited. (Crypto gateway not viable here.) ([Hacker News][31], [Coinbase][32])
  *(Square/Klarna and many mainstream wallets similarly restrict adult verticals.)* ([Square][33])

---

## Quick picks by use-case (how I’d wire FANZ today)

* **Cards + recurring**: CCBill or Segpay (primary), Vendo or CommerceGate (EU routing), Epoch (subscriptions at scale). ([CCBill][1], [Segpay][2], [Vendo][5])
* **ACH / local bank pay**: NETbilling (ACH), Vendo Pay-by-Bank (EU/LatAm pilots). ([Vendo][5])
* **Creator payouts**: Paxum (default), ePayService / CosmoPayment (backup), plus bank wires. ([Wikipedia][14], [epayservices.com][22])
* **Crypto tips/subs**: NOWPayments or CoinsPaid; settle to fiat via vetted exchange accounts (not Coinbase Commerce). ([NOWPayments][17], [CoinsPaid][18], [Hacker News][31])
* **Telco add-on** (where legal): Bango/Boku/DCB for upsells. ([Bango][25], [Nilson Report][26])

---

### Important caveats (so we don’t get clipped)

* Policies shift constantly (e.g., card-network rules for adult platforms). Build with multi-MID routing + hot-swap failover. ([VICE][34], [ACLU of Oklahoma][35])
* Sub-vertical matters (cams vs. fan sites vs. dating vs. studios): each provider’s AUP differs — pre-vet your exact flows (UGC pre-moderation, 2257/age-verification, chargeback plan). ([Segpay][36])

Want me to turn this into a living “FANZ Payments Matrix” (columns for AUP notes, rails, regions, fees, KYC, payout speeds) so your team can route by brand/geo in one glance? I can spin that up now.
